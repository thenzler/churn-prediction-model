# Visualizations Directory

This directory contains visualizations generated during data exploration and model evaluation.

Visualization types include:
- Data distributions and relationships
- Feature importance plots
- Model performance metrics
- SHAP explanations for individual predictions

The `explore_data.py` and `train_model.py` scripts generate these visualizations automatically.
